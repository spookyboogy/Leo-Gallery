A little js/jQuery project which uses LightGallery to display a gallery of cat photos.

Todo:

- embed date_photo_taken metadata into images and incorporate into html tagging
- implement getting image links/info from .json rather than hardcoding based on image filename pattern
- make script for building json out of images in /images, include in build script as well
- include thumbnail_generator script in build scripts
- add a nice topbar with buttons that act like tab switchers between separate albums
- separate purple and pink albums (if it seems appropriate), add other photos after cleaning/prepping them
