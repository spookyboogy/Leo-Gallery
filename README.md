# Leo's Gallery

A small JavaScript/jQuery project utilizing Light Gallery and Justified Gallery to showcase a gallery of cat photos.

## Todo:

- [ ] Add other LightGallery plugins
- [ ] Embed `date_photo_taken` metadata into images and incorporate it into HTML tagging
- [ ] Implement retrieving image links/info from a `.json` file rather than hardcoding based on image filename pattern
- [ ] Create a script for building JSON from images in the `/images` directory; include it in the build script
- [ ] Include the `thumbnail_generator` script in build scripts
- [ ] Design a stylish top bar with buttons that function as tab switchers between separate albums
- [ ] Consider separating purple and pink albums (if appropriate), and add other photos after cleaning/prepping them
